# Problem:
# 	Climbing Stairs (k steps)

# 	You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
# 	Each time you can climb 1..k steps.
# 	In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

# Framework for Solving DP Problems:
# 	1. Define the objective function
# 		f(i) is the number of distinct ways to reach the i-th stair by making 1 to k steps.
# 	2. Identify base cases
# 		f(0) = 1
# 		f(1) = 1
# 	3. Write down a recurrence relation for the optimized objective function
# 		f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + ... + f(n-k)
# 	4. What's the order of execution?
# 		bottom-up
# 	5. Where to look for the answer?
# 		f(n)


# Time complexity: O(nk)
# Space complexity: O(n)
