/*
Problem:
	Unique Paths

	A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'S' in the diagram below).
	The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
	The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'E' in the diagram below).

	How many possible unique paths are there?

	| S |   |   |   |
	+---+---+---+---+
	|   |   |   |   |
	+---+---+---+---+
	|   |   |   | E |
	+---+---+---+---+

	Above is a 3 x 4 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
